Electric flux, as an expression of the total electric field passing through a closed surface, is influenced only by charges within the surface and unaffected by distant charges located outside it.

Electric flux is not affected by distant charges outside the closed surface, whereas the net electric field, E, can be influenced by any charges positioned outside of the closed surface. In SI base units, the electric flux is expressed as kg·m3·s−3·A−1.\n","C: Gauss's law, which applies equally to all electric fields, is typically most useful when dealing with symmetric field configurations, like those with spherical or cylindrical symmetry, since it makes it easier to calculate the total electric flux.

Electric flux is expressed in SI base units as kg·m3·s−1·C.\n","D: Gauss's law only holds for electric fields with cylindrical symmetry, like those of a straight long wire; it is not applicable to fields with other types of symmetry.

The unit of electric flux in SI base units is kg·m2·s−2·A−1.\n","E: Gauss's law, which holds for all situations, is most beneficial when applied to electric fields that exhibit higher degrees of symmetry, like those with cylindrical and spherical symmetry.
